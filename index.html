    <li>Buger</li>
    <li>Sandwich</li>
    <li>Sushi</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Why do I like food from different regions?</h3>
  <ol type="i">
    <li> I traveled to Japan a few years ago, and it's very interesting seeing other bellies eating totally new food.
    </li>
    <li>I'm a belly and I'm always into trying new things, <strong>"Food Wise"</strong>.</li>
    <li>I used to have a gf belly where she will always order all kinds of food and not finish them all, so I had to eat
      all of them and that gives me the habit of trying different types of food, <strong>even only under 1
        meal!</strong></li>
